# To-do-List-Web-Application
Keep track of your day to day responsibilities with this application!

This application is powered by JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Heroku on the back-end. While it's front-end was developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. My goal with building this project was growing and refining my skills with CRUD operations. I took this project to the next level by hosting it on MongoDB's Atlas Database, and making the site itslef live using Heroku's web servers. 

Try out this feature: make your own personal and customized to-do list by adding it's name to the URL endpoint. For example if you wanted to make your own list for your Bora Bora trip, just append "/Bora Bora Trip" to the URL endpoint.

Your page will then look like the following: (https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90731159/168482639-ccb0d935-6f6c-45cc-ba2f-8228dd71957c.png)

I hope you enjoy and if you have any questions about the development process feel free to send me a message or email!
